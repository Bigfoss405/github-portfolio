    <!-- Enhancements -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Enhancements Completed</h2>

      <h3>Enhancement 1: Software Design and Architecture Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Refactored core components such as the DBHelper, event model,
          and UI activities to improve separation of concerns and modularity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved workflow between application screens to ensure consistent
          state management and smoother user interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          These changes improved code readability, maintainability,
          and overall application structure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Handling Optimization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improved how event data is retrieved, sorted, and passed
          between activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimized RecyclerView adapter lifecycle handling to ensure
          efficient and reliable UI updates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enhanced event object processing to improve application
          responsiveness when working with structured data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Enhancement 3: Database Design and CRUD Improvements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Refined the SQLite database schema to support more consistent
          and structured event storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved CRUD operations to ensure accurate, efficient,
          and secure data handling.
        </li>
        <li>
          Strengthened validation and interaction between the database
          layer and the user interface.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Enhancing EventBuddy during the capstone allowed me to revisit an
        earlier project and apply more advanced software engineering practices.
        I learned how to evaluate an existing system, identify structural
        weaknesses, and implement meaningful improvements across architecture,
        algorithms, and database design. This process strengthened my ability
        to build maintainable, efficient, and reliable mobile applications and
        better prepared me for real-world software development.
