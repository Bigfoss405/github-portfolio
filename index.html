      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

      <p>
        This professional self-assessment serves as a holistic introduction to my
        Computer Science ePortfolio. It reflects my growth throughout the program,
        highlights my technical and professional strengths, and explains how my
        capstone work demonstrates readiness for professional software engineering roles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through my coursework and capstone experience, I have strengthened my ability
        to design and engineer maintainable software systems, apply algorithmic reasoning
        to structured data, and develop reliable database-backed applications. My work
        emphasizes clean architecture, efficient data handling, and thoughtful problem
        solving across multiple computing environments.

      <h2>About This ePortfolio</h2>
      <p>
        This ePortfolio was developed as part of the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone
        at Southern New Hampshire University. It showcases my growth in software design
        and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management through
        the enhancement of a single comprehensive technical artifact.

    <!-- Project Summary -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Capstone Project: EventBuddy</h2>
      <p>
        EventBuddy is an Android mobile application originally developed to allow users
        to create, edit, and manage personal events using a local SQLite database.
        During the capstone, this project was enhanced to improve its architecture,
        algorithmic efficiency, and database design.
